Guess My Number


Simple guessing game where the user has to guess the number range (between 1-20). 

Created with JS, this program helped me learn more about dom manipulation and how to create the logic for a game. Will also repurpose some of this code for future projects as the logic behind the code will transfer to many other projects involving user input.
